Inspiration
In today's job market, possessing both technical and soft skills like communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities is crucial for success. However, many job seekers struggle to showcase their soft skills during the interview process, and employers often lack effective tools to assess and train their employees in these areas. That's why the SoftSkillBoost, formerly Team InterviewerReviewer and Team Recruiter Skills, projects were born - to provide innovative and comprehensive tools to bridge this gap and help job seekers and employers succeed.

What it does
InterviewerReviewer is an AI-powered tool that simulates a natural feeling interview environment and evaluates interviewee's responses while providing constructive feedback. The tool assesses not just what candidates say, but also how they say it and how they respond to difficult questions. Additionally, InterviewerReviewer offers interview education resources to help candidates prepare and present their best selves during the interview process. The ultimate goal of InterviewerReviewer is to help job seekers improve their communication skills and increase their chances of success in landing their dream job.

Team Recruiter Skills is an educational tool that helps job seekers understand the mindset of an interviewer and improve their job search strategies. It provides a series of interactive modules that teach job seekers how to research job openings, tailor their resume and cover letter to specific job postings, prepare for interviews, and negotiate job offers. Team Recruiter Skills also offers resources for employers to assess and train their employees in these areas. The ultimate goal of Team Recruiter Skills is to help job seekers and employers understand each other's perspectives and succeed in the hiring process.
